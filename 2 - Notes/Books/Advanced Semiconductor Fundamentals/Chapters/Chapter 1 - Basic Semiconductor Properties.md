> > It is an established fact that even extremely minute traces of impurity atoms can have detrimental effects on the electrical properties of semiconductors. For this reason the compositional purity of semiconductors must be very carefully controlled: in fact, modern semiconductors are some of the purest solid materials in existence.

> > Upon examining the many solid-state devices in existence, one finds examples of all three structural forms. An amorphous-Si thin-film transistor is used as the switching element in liquid crystal displays. Polycrystalline Si gates are employed in MctalOxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET's). In the vast majority of devices, however, the active region of the device is situated within a crystalline semiconductor.

> Some nice examples, however, I must note that in the second example the Polycrystalline Si is not used as a semiconductor. Is this really what's been trying to shown here?
