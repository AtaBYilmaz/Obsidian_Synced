For this reason the compositional purity of semiconductors must be very carefully controlled: in fact, modern semiconductors are some of the purest solid materials in existence.

> > Upon examining the many solid-state devices in existence, one finds examples of all three structural forms. An amorphous-Si thin-film transistor is used as the switching element in liquid crystal displays. Polycrystalline Si gates are employed in MctalOxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET's). In the vast majority of devices, however, the active region of the device is situated within a crystalline semiconductor.

> Some nice examples, however, I must note that in the second example the Polycrystalline Si is not used as a semiconductor. Is this really what's been trying to shown here?

> > In fact, to characterize real crystal lattices it is often necessary to associate a group of atoms or a molecule with each point on a Bravais lattice. Naturally, this increases the number of unique lattice arrangements. When the geometrical properties of the molecules or groups of atoms at each lattice point are taken into account, one finds that there are 230 different repetitive patterns in which atomic elements can be arranged to form actual crystal structures. We point this out because the unit cells for semiconductor crystals are typically more complex than Bravais cells
