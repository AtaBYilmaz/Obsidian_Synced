The vibrating atoms were modeled as harmonic oscillators with a spectrum of normal mode frequencies, $v = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi}$, and _a continuum of allowed energies_ distributed in accordance with statistical considerations

Yes, I still have no answers. Seems like this questions stands.

> But this is not correct either, right? Since it is not the atoms vibrating that radiates energy. Well you could think of it that way too, but energy is radiated when an electron moves down to a lower energy state. And it is due to the fact that an atom has discrete energy levels that this occurs, they are no harmonic oscillators.
